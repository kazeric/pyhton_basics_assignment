# Python Basics Assignment 

## Overview

This assignment covers fundamental Python programming concepts through interactive notebooks and hands-on coding challenges. The materials progress from basic variables and data types through control flow, functions, and object-oriented programming.

| `1_challenge.py` | Variables & Strings     | Beginner     |
| `2_challenge.py` | Data Types & Conversion | Beginner     |
| `3_challenge.py` | Collections             | Beginner     |
| `4_challenge.py` | Loops                   | Intermediate |
| `5_challenge.py` | Control Flow            | Intermediate |
| `6_challenge.py` | Functions               | Intermediate |

### Advanced Topic

| File           | Content                                                                |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `7_classes.py` | Object-Oriented Programming - Class design, methods, and relationships |

## Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you will be able to:

Declare and use variables effectively  
Work with all basic Python data types  
Manipulate collections (lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples)  
Control program flow with loops and conditionals  
Write reusable functions with proper parameters and returns  
Design and implement simple classes with methods  
Understand object-oriented programming principles

## How to Use This Assignment

### Step 1: Study the Notebooks

Read through each notebook (1-6) sequentially to understand the concepts.

### Step 2: Complete the Challenges

After each notebook, complete the corresponding challenge file to reinforce your learning.

### Step 3: Explore Classes

Review `7_classes.py` to see practical applications of OOP concepts.

### Step 4: Test Your Code

Run your challenge files to verify they work correctly:

```bash
python 1_challenge.py
python 2_challenge.py
# ... and so on
```

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook (for viewing .ipynb files)

## Tips for Success

- Take your time reading the notebooks and experimenting with the code
- Try to understand _why_ the code works, not just what it does
- Modify examples and test edge cases
- Complete all challenges before moving to the next topic
- Review previous topics if you get stuck

## Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Review the relevant notebook section
2. Check the challenge comments for hints
3. Test your code with `print()` statements to debug
4. Break problems into smaller, manageable parts
